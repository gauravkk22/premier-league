For this i have used node(npm module) and bower to install some dependencies and ran it on localhost on pyhton simple http server.
the command to run pyhton server : python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000   (8000 is the port number here).
I have used html5 local storage to save the data.
The dependencies used are :
1.angular-route
2.angular-timer
3.ng-dialog
 I have also used fontawesome of some the icons.
 Also some of the other javascript files used are appended in the index.html file.
rest of the files and images are in the zipped file.
---Images are stored in css/img folder.
---js files(like app.js) are in js folder.
